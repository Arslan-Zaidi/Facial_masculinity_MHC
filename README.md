## Scripts
  1. calc_masc_03262018.R : Script used to generate facial masculinity measures from 3D coorsinates data
  2. summary_stats_03262018.R : Script used to calculate summary statistics (e.g. degree of sexual dimorphism, cohen's D, and      Levene's test of equal variances) on facial masculinity
  3. masc_height_association_03262018.R : Script used to test for associations between facial masculinity and height                (Hypothesis 1). 
  4. height_hla_association_02272018.R : Script used to test for association between height and MHC heterozygosity 
     (Hypothesis 2).
  5. masc_hla_association_03262018.R : Script used to test for association between facial masculinity and MHC heterozygosity
     (Hypothesis 3).
  6. Plot1Face.R: Script used to visualize high-dimensional facial masculinity scores, as well as quasi-landmark based test        statistics (cohen's D, beta coefficients, p-values etc.) as facial heatmaps.
     
## Dataset
  1. _Euro_demographic_03292018.dat_\
  Dataframe containing demographic data for all 1,233 individuals used in the study. Columns are in the following order:\
  ... IID: Unique identifier for individual\
  ... phet_genome: Heterozygosity across genome-wide (LD-pruned) SNPs\
  ... phet_hla: Heterozygosity across MHC locus\
  ... Sex\
  ... Age\
  ... Height: In centimeters\
  ... Weight: In Kg\
  ... gPC1-4: genetic PC scores\
  
  2. _euro_1233_masc_het_03292018.dat_\
  Dataframe containing all the columns from Euro_demographic_03292018.dat and two additional columns:\
  a) avg.masc: Average facial masculinity calculated across all 7,150 QLs for each person\
  b) avg.masc.unit: Average facial masculinity scaled by the Euclidean distance between female and male consensus faces. 
     In other words, this is average facial masculinity divided by the average facial masculinity of the male consensus face.
     
  3. _qlmasc_1233_noprop_03292018.txt.zip_\
  Zipped text file containing high-dimensional facial masculinity scores (dimensions: 7,150 x 1,233) i.e. 3D facial masculinity calculated for 7,150 quasi-landmarks (rows) for each of 1,233 individuals (columns). Referred to in the paper as FM<sub>QL</sub>. No headers or indices included. The order of the individuals is the same as the order of individuals in Euro_demographic_03292018.dat file.
  
  4. _Refscan.obj_\
  .OBJ file containing the 3D facial template used to visualize facial heatmaps etc.

  5. _qlmasc_h_bysex_noprop_sd_04142018.txt_\
  ... slope_female: beta coefficients for FM<sub>QL</sub> - females only
